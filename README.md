# PROGRESS:

Fully implemented features:
● Extracting base58 addresses from the digital image
● Uploading the digital image containing base58 addresses
● Searching the cryptocurrency according to the address provided
Partially implemented features:
● All the features are implemented separately but not integrated .

# FUTURE SCOPE:
1. User can simply insert the public and the private keys and get the relevant
cryptocurrencies
2. BTC scan only provides the relevant cryptocurrencies for the bitcoin but now it
can also scan for the base58 addresses for the other cryptocurrenccies.
APPLICATIONS:
1. For searching from the digital iamge containing base58 addresses you just
have to upload the image from the upload section of the wwebiste .
2. After uploading the image click on the submit button the algorithm will
extract the base58 address form the image
3. For the public and the private keys search option insert the public na dthe
private keys in the relevant fields
4. If any of the two public or the private keys exist we can get the relevant
crypto currency for that .
5. If the format of the keys already exist in the database then it will show
thww relevant currency and and if not then also displays the relevant new
currency
